CONFLICTING NODES (0)
---------------------------------


BUILD OPTIONS
-------------

OPTION 1: Unified Build (Recommended - Single Image)
  File: set-unified.txt
  Nodes: 0 (all nodes)
  ComfyUI: latest
  Manager: latest
  Strategy: Latest ComfyUI packages override conflicting node requirements
  ⚠ 0 conflicting nodes will use ComfyUI's package versions
  ⚠ These nodes may not function correctly


OPTION 2: Split Builds (Not Available)
  ✗ No compatible ComfyUI version found for set-off nodes
  Only Option 1 (Unified) or Option 3 (Exclude) are viable

OPTION 3: Latest Only (Exclude Incompatible Nodes)
  File: set-base.txt
  Nodes: 0
  ComfyUI: latest
  Manager: latest
  Strategy: Exclude 0 problematic nodes entirely

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Use Option 1 (Unified Build) - no compatible ComfyUI version exists.
Test if 0 conflicting nodes work with package overrides.
If critical functionality breaks, use Option 3 to exclude them.
